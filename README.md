# Registration Algorithm Project

## Brief Project Description
This project takes Allegheny College's current method of determining registration letter groups and improves upon in a way many students seem to thing would be more fair. This is done by the creation of a new algorithm.

Please read the document entitled `finalReport.pdf` in the `docs` folder and related folders for more information and a complete project overview.

## Running The Program
To run the Letter Group Organizer Algorithm and its associated program, first ensure you have Python3 installed on your machine.

Then navigate to the `src` folder of the project.

You can then run the following command to run the entire program:
```
python3 interface.py
```

## File Organization
This project contains a variety of folders. Their purposes are detailed below:
- `data` folder: Contains data related to the project.
  - `input` folder: Contains sample student input data (sample lists of students).  
  - `output` folder: Where users can choose to output their sorted students (by letter group).
- `docs` folder: Contains the documents related to the project. Specifically, writing documents (most importantly `finalReport.pdf`) and presentation slides.
- `src` folder: Contains all of the source code for the project.
  - `file_reader.py`: Reads in input files.
  - `interface.py`: The interface and "driver"/main file for the program.
    This is the file that should be used to run the program..
  - `organizer.py`: The Letter Group Organizer algorithm.
